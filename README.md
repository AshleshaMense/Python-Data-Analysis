**Black Friday Analysis :-**
*Overview*
This project is a small-scale data analysis conducted to explore Black Friday shopping trends using Python's Pandas library. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about various transactions made during Black Friday sales.

*Purpose*
The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the usage of Pandas for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Through this project, users can gain insights into consumer behavior, product preferences, and other relevant patterns observed during Black Friday sales.

*Data*
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Cloudyml]. It includes attributes such as customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, etc.

*Analysis*
The analysis conducted in this project includes:
1.Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, data cleaning, etc.
2.Insights extraction: Identifying trends, popular products, peak shopping times, etc.

*Requirements*
To run the code in this project, you need the following:
Python 3.x
Pandas library
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)

**Haberman Dataset Analysis Project**
*Overview*
This project is a demonstration of exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on the Haberman dataset using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. The Haberman dataset contains survival data for patients who had undergone surgery for cancer.

*Purpose*
The primary goal of this project is to explore the Haberman dataset and gain insights into factors affecting the survival of cancer patients . Through this analysis, we aim to understand patterns, trends, and potential predictors of survival, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dataset and the domain.

*Dataset*
The Haberman dataset comprises the following attributes:
Age of patient at the time of operation
Patient's year of operation (year of surgery)
Number of positive axillary nodes detected
Survival status (1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer; 2 = the patient died within 5 years)

*Analysis*
The analysis conducted in this project includes:
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, data cleaning, etc.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Visualization of distributions, survival rates, correlation analysis, etc.
Insights extraction: Identifying factors influencing survival, survival trends over time, etc.

*Requirements*
To run the code in this project, you need the following:
Python 3.x
Matplotlib
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
